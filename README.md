# Polylang Language Learning Service 
As someone who struggles with learning new words, I decided to create this language learning app to make my own learning experience easier and more personalized. While I don't have much experience in artificial intelligence, I am eager to learn and incorporate these technologies into this project.

## Background
Learning a new language can be a challenging task, especially when it comes to building vocabulary and practicing conversational skills. Traditional language learning methods often lack the personalization and interactivity that are essential for effective learning.

With this in mind, I decided to create a language learning app that would incorporate artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide users with a variety of tools to help them learn new words, practice pronunciation, and improve their language skills.

## Features
- Vocabulary builder to add and learn new words
- Flashcards to memorize words and their meanings
- Spaced repetition algorithm to optimize learning
- Speech recognition to practice pronunciation
- Personalized quizzes to test knowledge
- Chatbot to practice conversational skills
